    "Eq. {eq}`Newton2nd` shows that the acceleration produced by the force\n",

    "We require the initial positions and velocities of all $N$ particles to solve Eq. [](Newton2nd_N). In practice, however, the exact many-body forces are  complicated, nonlinear functions and the resulting dynamics are highly complex. Any attempt to find an analytic solution to the equations of motion of a many-body system is therefore futile. Moreover, if we give up trying to obtain an analytic solution and are content with solving Eq. [](Newton2nd_N) numerically for a macroscopic system with $\\sim 10^{23}$ particles, it would require more computational resources than are currently (or in the foreseeable future) available. This infamous problem is called the \"n-body problem\" when the interaction between the particles is gravitational and it is still an area of active research in [Astronomy](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/the-100-billion-body-problem). So, is all hope lost? No! The essence of MD simulations is to instead solve Eq. [](Newton2nd_N) numerically for a large, but much smaller, number of particles, typically ranging between $100-10^6$, typically in a box of given volume under some specified boundary conditions (representing a solid, for example, more about this later). It turns out that this approach works remarkably well, and many properties are converged to their bulk values for this much smaller number of particles. Before describing MD simulations in detail, we first introduce the concept of phase space, and then look into alternative formulations of classical mechanics which will be of use in the following lessons.\n"

The new coordinates are often called **generalized coordinates**. This is because the Euler-Lagrange equations, Eq. [](EL_eq), do not change under such **point transformations**. Lagrangian mechanics also allow us to handle constraints in a much more straightforward manner than Newtonian dynamics. Finally, Lagrangian mechanics are convenient to prove a remarkable result - that conservation laws are related to symmetry! This is a topic of some depth, and we will barely scratch the surface with a simple example.\n",

In other words, the tension force is required to make sure the mass doesn't move in the radial direction, i.e., that the constraint on the length of the spring is fulfilled. Then, we would write down the equations of motions for each force component and after some algebraic manipulations we would get the equations for the dynamics of the angle $\\phi$ and an expression for the tension force. Let us see how simple this process gets with the Lagrangian formalism instead.\n",

Every $N$-particles trajectory, $\\textbf{Q}(t), \\dot{\\textbf{Q}}(t)$, that fulfills the boundary conditions, (i.e., starts from $\\textbf{Q}(t_1)$ with $\\dot{\\textbf{Q}}(t_1)$ and ends at $\\textbf{Q}(t_2)$ with $\\dot{\\textbf{Q}}(t_2))$, uniquely defines the time evolution of the Lagrangian which in turn translates to a specific value of the action.

Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman), which beautifully connects classical and quantum mechanics on the same framework involving the action integral. Its core observation that while in classical mechanics there is one path that connects the initial and final points, the one that makes the action stationary, in quantum mechanics we have to sum over all possible paths - called a path integral."
