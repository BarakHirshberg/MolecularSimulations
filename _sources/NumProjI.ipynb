In it, you will find the definitions and details of the specific simulations you have to run. It also contains questions that you need to answer and figures you need to plot. Create a separate run script for each one of the sections in the notebook (`run_harmonic.py` and `run_Ar.py`), run the simulations, and answer the questions. Submit your report by commiting and pushing the file to your repo. "
