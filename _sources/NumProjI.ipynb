    "## Installing the Anaconda Python distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) is a very popular Python distribution, aimed for scientific computing. It bundles several useful packages, such as [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). If you need to refresh your knowledge in Python, please see the [SciPy lecture notes](https://scipy-lectures.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing Anaconda is free, just follow these [instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) for Linux, Mac or Windows operating systems. Anaconda also includes a light Integrated Development Environment (IDE) called [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/). If you already know and like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [Vistual Studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) instead, go ahead and use whatever IDE you like. I cannot, however, help you debug your setup unless you use Spyder and Anaconda. You can also use any text editor and just run your code through the terminal. But an IDE gives convenient access to powerful tools for modern programming including debugging, profiling, syntax highlighting and editing, etc.\n"

    "## GitHub basics\n",
    "\n",
    "[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a code hosting platform for software development. It relies on an open-source version control system called [Git](https://git-scm.com/). De facto, all software development projects today use some kind of version control. It allows us to develop the code together as a team, keep track of changes, suggest new features, and merge everything together in a simple workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic object is a *repository* (\"repo\"), which stores all of the source code for the project.\n",
    "You can create your own repo, or *clone* (GitHub jargon for copying) an existing repo.\n",
    "You cal also *fork* a repo, which is similar to cloning, but you typically do it when you want to contribute your changes back to the original repo, and not just develop you own version of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each repository can have several *branches*. The default one is called *main*.\n",
    "When you want to implement a new feature, the typical workflow is to clone the repository and create a new branch dedicated to your feature. In this way, you will not change the main version of the code while you work. Next, you develop the new feature by adding or editing the source code. Every time you would like to save a checkpoint that you could return to if needed, you should *commit* your changes and *push* them to update the remote repositoy. When you want to discuss your changes and consult with your team, you can create a *pull request* on GitHub.\n",
    "Once you are done with all changes, you need to *merge* your branch back with the original main branch. This is done by closing the pull request and merging.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first \"assignment\" is an exercise, developed by GitHub, to let you practice this workflow. It will exaplin everything I mentioned in brief and more. \n",
    "To do it, first choose wether you will be working with the terminal or graphical user interface (GUI).\n",
    "\n",
    "Prerequisites for all:\n",
    "- Create a free account on [GitHub](https://github.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Prerequisites for GUI users:\n",
    "- Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to clone, commit and push to repo.\n",
    "- Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and work with Spyder to edit files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prerequisites for terminal users:\n",
    "- Windows: Install WSL. Follow these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).\n",
    "- All OS: Install Anaconda with Spyder through terminal, see instructions [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). You can use the following command to fetch the installer for Linux directly from the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2021.11-Linux-x86_64.sh\n",

    "\n",
    "Both:\n",
    "- Click the invitation link from GitHub Classroom. This creates your personal Git & GitHub Fundamentals repo. Currently it only has one text file ```README.md``` which explains the GitHub workflow. Read it carefully, follow the links as needed, and make sure your understand before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clone the repo locally to your computer. The changes you will make on your local copy will not affect the remote one, until you push your changes (see last step below).\n",
    "```\n",
    "git  clone https://github.com/Molecular-Simulations-Course/git-github-fundamentals-YOURNAME.git\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Create you own branch and switch to working in it using the command \n",
    "```\n",
    "git checkout -b feature\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Create a new Markdown file `Hello_world.md` using Spyder and add to it some text.\n",
    "- Commit your changes.\n",
    "```\n",
    "git commit Hello_world.md\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Push your changes to the remote repo.\n",
    "```\n",
    "git push\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Go back to GitHub to your repo and open a pull request, assign Barak as reviewer. I will give you feedback and make comments. If you are done, I will close the pull request and merge your branch feature into your main branch. Then, I will also delete the feature branch, which is no longer needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the steps above can also be done using the GUI of GitHub desktop instead."
