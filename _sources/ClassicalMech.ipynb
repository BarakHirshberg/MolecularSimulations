    "You are all familiar with this formulation of classical mechanics, \n",
    "so we will go over it very briefly.\n",
    "In his masterpiece \"Principia\", first published in 1687(!), \n",
    "Newton formulated his three celebrated laws of motion. \n",
    "The first two can be succinctly summarized in the equation,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "m \\ddot{ \\textbf{r} } = \\textbf{F},\n",
    "$$ (Newton2nd)\n",
    "\n",
    "where $m$ and $ \\textbf{r}(t) = [x(t), y(t), z(t)] $ are the mass and \n",
    "the Cartesian position vector of the particle, respectively. The single and double \n",
    "dot represent the first and second time-derivatives, respectively, \n",
    "and $\\textbf{F}$ is the force acting on the particle.\n",
    " We will denote vectors by bold letters throughout the course. \n",
    " Eq. {eq}`Newton2nd`\n",
    "  is a second-order differential equation. \n",
    " To solve it, we require two **initial conditions**, namely, \n",
    " the position and velocity at $t=0$. The solution of the equation \n",
    " specifying the position of a particle in time (which also gives the \n",
    " velocity by differentiation) is called a **trajectory**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eq. {eq}`Newton2nd` shows that the acceleration produced by the force\n",
    " $\\textbf{F}$ acting on the particle is equal to the force divided by the \n",
    " particle's mass, also known as Newton's second law or Newton's equation of \n",
    " motion. It also embodies the first law which states that in the \n",
    " absence of force, a body will remain at rest or move in a straight \n",
    " line with constant velocity. This can be seen by setting \n",
    " $\\textbf{F} = 0$  in Eq. {eq}`Newton2nd` and integrating twice to get \n",
    " $\\dot{ \\textbf{r} } =  \\textbf{v}$ and \n",
    " $\\textbf{r} = \\textbf{r}(0) + \\textbf{v}t$. Newton's third law states \n",
    " that \"for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction\", \n",
    " i.e., that if $\\textbf{F}_{12}$ is the force that particle 1 exerts \n",
    " on particle 2, then\n",

    "We require the initial positions and velocities of all $N$ particles to solve Eq. [](Newton2nd_N). In practice, however, the exact many-body forces are  complicated, nonlinear functions and the resulting dynamics are highly complex. Any attempt to find an analytic solution to the equations of motion of a many-body system is therefore futile. Moreover, if we give up trying to obtain an analytic solution and are content with solving Eq. [](Newton2nd_N) numerically for a macroscopic system with $\\sim 10^{23}$ particles, it would require more computational resources than are currently (or in the foreseeable future) available. This infamous problem is called the \"n-body problem\" when the interaction between the particles is gravitational and it is still an area of active research in [Astronomy](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/the-100-billion-body-problem). So, is all hope lost? No! The essence of MD simulations is to instead solve Eq. [](Newton2nd_N) numerically for a large, but much smaller, number of particles, typically ranging between $100-10^6$, typically in a box of given volume under some specified boundary conditions (representing a solid, for example, more about this later). It turns out that this approach works remarkably well, and many properties converge to their bulk values for this much smaller number of particles. Before describing MD simulations in detail, we first introduce the concept of phase space, and then look into alternative formulations of classical mechanics which will be of use in the following lessons.\n"

The new coordinates are often called **generalized coordinates**. This is because the Euler-Lagrange equations, Eq. [](EL_eq), do not change under such **point transformations**. Lagrangian mechanics also allow us to handle constraints in a much more straightforward manner than Newtonian dynamics. Finally, Lagrangian mechanics are convenient to prove a remarkable result - that conservation laws are related to symmetry!

In other words, the tension force is required to make sure the mass doesn't move in the radial direction, i.e., that the constraint on the length of the spring is fulfilled. Then, we would write down the equations of motions for each force component and after some algebraic manipulations, we would get the equations for the dynamics of the angle $\\phi$ and an expression for the tension force.

    "We have so far presented the classical equations of motions, be it in the Hamiltonian or the Lagrangian formalism, without deriving them. The question arises - can we derive the Euler-Lagrange equations, and from them Hamilton's and Newton's equations, from some underlying general principle? The answer is positive. \n",

    "For brevity, we will denote collectively $\\textbf{q}_1(t),...,\\textbf{q}_N(t)$ as $\\textbf{Q}(t) $ and similarly for the time derivatives.\n",
    "Note that while the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian are **functions** of the coordinates and velocities or momenta, the action is a **functional**. A functional is a mathematical object that takes a function as input and maps it uniquely to some number, similarly to how a function takes one number as input and maps it uniquely to another number. Every $N$-particles trajectory, $\\textbf{Q}(t), \\dot{\\textbf{Q}}(t)$, that fulfills the boundary conditions, (i.e., starts from $\\textbf{Q}(t_1)$ with $\\dot{\\textbf{Q}}(t_1)$ and ends at $\\textbf{Q}(t_2)$ with $\\dot{\\textbf{Q}}(t_2))$, uniquely defines the time evolution of the Lagrangian which in turn translates to a specific value of the action. Alternatively, the difference between a functional and a function is that the action depends on all values of the trajectory between two points while the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian depend only on the value of the trajectory in some specific instance in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that the Euler-Lagrange equations can be derived by postulating that the classical trajectory makes the first variation of the action integral vanish. The first variation of a functional is an extension of the definition of derivatives to the world of functionals. \n",

    "Is this postulate involving the first variation of the action more fundamental than the three laws of Newton or the Euler-Lagrange equations? In the last project of this course, some of you will work on incorporating quantum effects into your classical MD simulations. You will then encounter an ingenious formulation of quantum mechanics, due to Nobel Laureate [Richard P. Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman), which beautifully connects classical and quantum mechanics on the same framework involving the action integral. Its core observation is that while in classical mechanics there is one path that connects the initial and final points, the one that makes the action stationary, in quantum mechanics we have to sum over all possible paths - called a path integral."
