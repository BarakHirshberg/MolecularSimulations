    "Now that you have mastered how to sample arbitrary distribution functions using the Metropolis algorithm, you are ready to tackle the second exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will use the same repository as for the first exercise. Note that you will need your code to evaluate the LJ potential and a harmonic trap working also for the second exercise. If it did not work in the previous exercise, you have another shot at correcting it. But if you are truly stuck and it does not work, contact Barak for help as soon as possible.\n",

    "You goal is to implement a Metropolis MC simulations in the canonical ensemble. To do that, you will need to add two methods to your simulations class. The first, `MCstep`, performs a single translation move and decided whether to accept or reject it. The second, `runMC`, contains the instructions for performing an MC simulation, similarly to how `run` holds the instructions for an MD simulation. As usual, the docstring for each method contains all of the relevant information.\n",
