    "We have seen that using the tools of statistical mechanics thermodynamic properties can be obtained through ensemble averages. The next challenge is to generate a set of samples of different microstates that are distributed according to the equilibrium phase space distribution function. This is exactly the idea behind MD and MC simulations. However, there is a key difference between the two methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "In their simplest form, MD simulations rely on the realization that the classical equations of motion of $N$ particles, isolated in a box of volume $V$ and acted upon by conservative forces, naturally generate samples from the microcanonical ensemble. The fixed energy $E$ is determined by the initial conditions, which we will elaborate on later. It is possible, but not straightforward, to generate samples from other ensembles through MD simulations.\n",

    "In contrast, MC simulations generate samples from the equilibrium phase space distribution of various ensembles through a random process. In this chapter, we first discuss $NVE$ MD in detail. Then, you will write the code for the first numerical project implementing your very own MD simulation. Then, we will do the same for MC simulations in the canonical ensemble.\n"

The figure of merit is that the energy does not change more than $0.1 \\%$ of its initial value. You can get a good estimate of what this time step might be, by considering the fastest motion in the system. In molecular systems, it is typically the vibrational frequencies of H-X stretching modes (X=N, C, O) that are the fastest.

    "## Periodic boundary conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already discussed that solving the classical equations of motion for $\\sim 10^{23}$ particles is impossible and the MD simulations solve them for smaller systems, with $10-10^6$ particles. Luckily, many properties already converge to their bulk values. This is largely thanks to the use of **periodic boundary conditions**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main problem with simulating small systems is their unrealistic surface area to volume ratio. This means that molecules on the surface feel different forces than molecules in the bulk of the material. If we had tried to simulate liquid water with a model of 10 or 100 water molecules in a cluster, the model would not be very accurate for most properties because of surface effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to take our cubic box and replicate it in space in all three directions. During the simulation, for every molecule in the simulation box, there is an identical copy, called an **image**, in each one of the replicated cells. The image moves exactly in the same manner as the original molecules in the center box. If a molecule leaves the box through one of its sides, its periodic image enters through the opposite direction. In this way, the density is conserved in the central box. We do not need to store the coordinates of all of the(infinitely many) images. It is sufficient to keep just the coordinates of the $N$ particles in the main box and switch between images when one leaves it and the other enters. \n",

    "How large should be the main box so that the properties of the simulated system resemble the properties of a bulk liquid or solid? It depends on the interactions. If they are relatively short-ranged, then a small box may suffice. For the LJ potential, a box of side length $L=6\\sigma$ is usually sufficient. But for very long-range interaction, this is not the case, and more sophisticated methods are needed, of which we will not elaborate. In addition, this approach works when the fluctuations of the system in space are much smaller than the size of the box. So for the case of a gas-liquid phase transition, where the fluctuations are macroscopic (you can see the bubbles form!), this approach will not work. However, for systems far away from phase transitions and with short-range interactions, it is found to be highly successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, while periodic boundary conditions are great, they seem to have created a new problem. Now that we have infinitely many images of every particle, how are we to calculate the interaction between all of them? The practice is to overcome this problem by defining a spherical cutoff for the interaction of short-ranged potentials. One way to do it is by implementing the **minimum image convention**. The minimum image convention states that for each particle $i$, you calculate the interaction only with the closest image of particle $j$. This is done similarly for testing for periodic boundary conditions, but instead of applying it to the position vector of each particle, you use the distances between the particles. The minimum image convention effectively introduces a spherical cutoff to the potential at a distance of half the box length."
