    "# Basic statistical mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "After deriving the equations of motion for a system of $N$ classical particles, we would next like to solve for their trajectories and use them to evaluate thermodynamic properties of a macroscopic system, such as the temperature, energy, pressure, etc. If we can connect an observable macroscopic property $A$ to some function of the microstate of the system, $a(\\textbf{x})$, we might associate the measured value of $A$ with a **time average**, denoted by $\\bar{a}_{\\tau}$ and defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A = \\bar{a}_{\\tau} =  \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\int_0^{\\tau} a(\\textbf{x}(t)) \\mathrm{d} t,\n",
    "$$ (time-av)\n",
    "where $\\tau$ is some long time scale compared to the molecular or atomic motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "But now we find ourselves at an impasse. It is entirely clear what rules determine the evolution of the system in time, but solving the equations analytically is impossible. A numerical solution is similarly unfeasible for $\\sim 10^{23}$ particles, as we discussed in [the previous chapter](discussion).  The core idea of statistical mechanics is to provide an alternative approach to obtain macroscopic thermodynamic observables. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Ensembles\n",
    "\n",
    "It was [J.W. Gibbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Willard_Gibbs) that realized that thermodynamic macroscopic properties are not very sensitive to the details of the specific microscopic state of the system. Consider for example the temperature. You have learned in a preceding statistical thermodynamics course that each momentum degree of freedom contributes $\\frac{1}{2} k_B T $ to the average thermal kinetic energy (the [equipartition theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equipartition_theorem)). Thus, the temperature can be obtained from the average kinetic energy of the system. But there are many ways to choose the momenta of the particles such that the average kinetic energy is the same. In other words, the temperature is insensitive to the specific microstate of the system, as long as it gives the same average kinetic energy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Following this reasoning, and to make progress in connecting microscopic properties with thermodynamic observables, Gibbs introduced the concept of an **ensemble**. An ensemble is a collection of $\\mathcal{N}$ systems that obey the same microscopic interactions and are characterized by a common set of three thermodynamic properties, such as the number of particles $N$, the volume $V$, the total energy $E$, the temperature $T$, the pressure $P$ or the chemical potential $\\mu$. Each system in the ensemble evolves in time from different initial conditions and is characterized by a unique microscopic state defined by its path in phase space, $\\textbf{x}(t)$, defined in Eq. [](x_phase_space). The entire ensemble can then be represented as a \"cloud\" of points in phase space.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the function $f(\\textbf{x},t)$, called the **phase space distribution function**, as the probability density of observing a system in the ensemble in a specific microstate at time $t$. Since it is a probability density, it has to fulfill the properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    " \\int f(\\textbf{x},t) \\, \\mathrm{d} \\textbf{x} &= 1, & f(\\textbf{x},t) & \\ge 0.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, $f(\\textbf{x},t) \\, \\mathrm{d} \\textbf{x}$ represents the probability that a system from the ensemble is in the volume element between $\\textbf{x}$ and $\\mathrm{d} \\textbf{x}$ at time $t$ (or, alternatively, the fraction of systems therein).\n",
    "\n",
    "Gibbs then postulated that instead of using the time average of Eq. [](time-av), macroscopic properties can be obtained by freezing the ensemble at some time instance and taking the average of the desired observable over all the systems, called an **ensemble average**. More formally, the ensemble average, denoted as $\\langle a \\rangle_f$, is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A(t) = \\langle a \\rangle_f = \\int f(\\textbf{x},t) a(\\textbf{x}) \\, \\mathrm{d} \\textbf{x}.\n",
    "$$ (ensemble_av)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the difference between Eqs. [](time-av) and [](ensemble_av), the former is an integral over time while the latter is an integral over phase space. This distinction is important enough that we have used a bar to denote the time average but brackets to denote the ensemble average. Before moving forward, and discussing what we can do with ensemble averages, we will briefly investigate an important property of the phase space distribution function, described by the **Liouville equation**.\n"

    "## Phase space incompressibility\n",
    "\n",
    "An important consequence of the Liouville equation is that of **phase space incompressibility**. We denote an initial point in phase space as $\\textbf{x}_0 = [q_0,p_0]$. The point in phase space that results from the dynamics starting from $\\textbf{x}(0)$ after time $t$ is $\\textbf{x}_t = [q_t,p_t]$. In the previous chapter, we learned that the trajectory is uniquely defined by the initial conditions, meaning that $\\textbf{x}_t$ can be written as a function of the initial conditions,\n",
