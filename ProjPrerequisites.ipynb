    "\n",
    "[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a code hosting platform for software development. It relies on an open-source version control system called [Git](https://git-scm.com/). De facto, all software development projects today use some kind of version control. It allows us to develop the code together as a team, keep track of changes, suggest new features, and merge everything in a simple workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic object is a *repository* (\"repo\"), which stores all of the source code for the project.\n",
    "You can create your repo or *clone* (GitHub jargon for copying) an existing repo.\n",
    "You can also *fork* a repo, which is similar to cloning, but you typically do it when you want to contribute your changes back to the original repo and not just develop your version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each repository can have several *branches*. The default one is called *main*.\n",
    "When you want to implement a new feature, the typical workflow is to clone the repository and create a new branch dedicated to your feature. In this way, you will not change the main version of the code while you work. Next, you develop the new feature by adding or editing the source code. Every time you would like to save a checkpoint that you could return to if needed, you should *commit* your changes and *push* them to update the remote repository. When you want to discuss your changes and consult with your team, you can create a *pull request* on GitHub.\n",
    "Once you are done with all changes, you must *merge* your branch back with the original main branch. This is done by closing the pull request and merging.\n"

    "## Test Driven Development\n",
    "Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code. The process involves writing a test for a specific functionality, running the test to see it fail (since the feature is not yet implemented), and then writing the minimum amount of code required to pass the test. After the code passes the test, it is refactored to improve its structure while ensuring that all tests still pass. TDD promotes better design, higher code quality, and ensures that the software is thoroughly tested from the outset, leading to fewer bugs and more maintainable code."

    "Under TDD guidelines, you will work with Python's doctest module. It allows you to embed test cases directly in your docstrings and run them as part of your documentation. By writing tests within the docstrings of your functions, classes, or modules, doctest can execute these snippets of code to verify that they produce the expected output. This approach is useful for ensuring that your code examples in documentation are accurate and up-to-date. It also serves as a lightweight testing framework, making it easy to validate small units of code without needing a separate test script. Doctest promotes writing clear and executable documentation, which can improve code reliability and maintainability. "
